# 2020 U.S. Covid-19 2020 Rates and Counts

This projects includes two maps that display information about Covid-19 in each county of the United States. We are able to view the rates of case for each county's total population, as well as the total overall cases.

These two maps were made using the javascript library Mapbox.
